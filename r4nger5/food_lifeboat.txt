The Food "Lifeboat": food and nutrition considerations in the event of a
pandemic or other catastrophe

Large catastrophes have caused the collapse of empires and civilizations
. Science and knowledge may help prevent some catastrophes, but
urbanisation and narrowly concentrated food supplies, climate change and
terrorism contribute to considerable risk. Viruses such as SARS (severe
acute respiratory syndrome) and influenza A/(H5N1) or "bird flu" are
among the most immediately identifiable risks. In the event of a highly
lethal pandemic, emergency measures such as closing schools, staying
home with family and friends, avoiding contact with other people (until
all have been immunized) will be instrumental in avoiding infection.
Individuals in essential services or occupations may be required to
reside at their workplace for the whole period of the crisis. To achieve
this type of isolation, sufficient food must be available, and ways to
distribute the food must be planned.

But which foods and in what quantities? It is logical that they should
be staples and well accepted, easy to store, packed where possible in an
inert gas for a longer shelf life and not dependent on refrigeration.
Importantly, they will be nutrient dense providing the recommended
macro- and micronutrients for all members of the family. Ideally, they
can be eaten without cooking in case gas and electricity fail. Cost,
volume and storage space are further considerations.

In Table 1 we provide an example of a food list providing 9 MJ per day
for 10 weeks for one person that covers all known nutrient needs. This
example was generated using the nutrient analysis software Foodworks®
(5), which is based on the composition of Australian foods and commonly
used by Australian dietitians.  The recommended daily intake of specific
macronutrients and micronutrients for adults and children is published
by the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing. Together,
these two sources make it possible to compose diets with the appropriate
quantity of nutrients. As the majority of the population has no access
to detailed nutrient data, we have developed these examples to
demonstrate what is needed and typical of what might be acceptable.  We
acknowledge that such food lists are culturally and ethnic-specific and
that other food combinations are possible.

Total daily ration gives 9.0 MJ, providing 80 g protein, 80 g fat,
thereof 23 g saturated fat (10 % of total energy intake is coming from
saturated fat, and 31% of the fat intake is saturated fat), 18 g
polyunsaturated fat (22% of the fat intake), 35 g monounsaturated fat
(47% of the fat intake). The cholesterol intake is 101 mg per day.
Percent of energy from protein, fat and carbohydrate: 16 E% protein, 34
E% fat, 50 E% carbohydrates. Recommended intake of all nutrients is
covered for women and men, except for folate intake which is not covered
for women of childbearing age, therefore they may consider a folate
supplement. *In case of lactose intolerance, the intake of dry milk
powder may be reduced and replaced by soy protein powder. Alternatively,
the milk may be fermented and used in form of sour milk.

The cost of this diet for 10 weeks for one person is about $500. The
most expensive items are: Milk powder, Weet-Bix, spam, chocolate.
Table 2

Example of a list of simple dry foods that will cover basic energy needs
(9 MJ per day), and most nutrients except vitamin C and vitamin A. Daily
food ration and purchase list for 10 weeks for one person is shown. The
food items could be packed in airtight packages filled with inert gas of
a few kilos per package, and stored in food stores throughout the
country. In addition multivitamin tablets have to be provided.

Food 				            g/day 	kg/person/10weeks

Wheat flour, wholemeal plain 	150 	10.5
Oats, raw 			            100 	7.0

This example gives 9 MJ per day, with 80 g protein and 76 g fat, thereof
14 g saturated fat (6 % of the energy intake comes from saturated fat
and 20% of the fat intake is saturated fat), 18 g polyunsaturated fat
(26% of the fat is polyunsaturated fat) and 39 g monounsaturated fat
(54% of the fat is monounsaturated fat). The daily cholesterol intake is
43 mg. Percent of energy from protein, fat and carbohydrate: 16 E%
protein, 32 E% fat, 52 E% carbohydrates. Recommended intake of nutrients
is covered for women and men, except for vitamin C and vitamin A, and
these would have to be given as supplements and for women at
childbearing age the intake of folate and iron is lower than recommended.

*In case of lactose intolerance, the intake of dry milk powder may be
reduced and replaced by soy protein powder. Alternatively, the milk may
be fermented and used in fermented, sour form.

In addition, about 2 litres of water per day per person would be required.

This diet costs about 250 $ for one person for 10 weeks. The most
expensive items are: dry milk powder and noodles.
Preparing Your Pantry and Meals

Overview

The food items listed provide sufficient nutrition for the body�s needs.
This does not mean you are limited to the suggested foods; however
substitutions can impact on the nutrients provided by the diet.

Pantry Maintenance

It is important when foods are stored for use later in the week, month
or year that the use by date is evident and that older supplies are used
first. It is recommended that 10 weeks supply of food items is necessary
to be stored in the pantry, freezer and refrigerator. Practicality
recommends that freezer and refrigerator items should be kept to the
minimum. Start by ascertaining the meals /foods that you and your family
prefer eating and whether they can replace some of the items on the food
lists with nutritional security. Identify the foods on our list that do
not routinely appear in your meals or snacks and begin trying new
recipes so you have a series of meals and snacks that your family will
eat if necessary. Each week buy a few additional foods for the pantry
with a good date life eg some pasta have 2-3 years shelf life. Do not
stockpile foods in a separate place allowing them to go out of date.
Make them part of your normal pantry and replace when used. When
purchasing foods, consider the size of the packaging. Some foods
deteriorate quickly once opened and for these, buy the packaging size
sufficient for one meal only.

Meal Preparation

Review your regular family recipes. Water and power supplies may be
disrupted during an outbreak of pandemic flu and this will influence
meal preparation. Because of this the meals that can be prepared with
minimal implements and equipment are ideal ie one pot cookery. Make a
file of these recipes. Another member of the family may need to prepare
the meals if you are unwell. It is important that we do drink water
everyday and not waste supplies for the washing and cleaning of
excessive pots nor wasting cooking water. Rice should be cooked using
the absorption method and the water left over from cooking pasta should
be reused in soups and casseroles, wherever possible. Consider a supply
of paper plates should water for dishwashing becomes limited.
