23:07 < icuubi> [ Hacker OPSEC ] - grugq.github.io
23:13 < kevinisageek> gives out basic but good info on how to maintain OPSEC
23:13 < kevinisageek> even though it is basic info, folk still don't follow it to their downfall
23:14 < kevinisageek> i think data leaks are what get folk arrested
23:14 < kevinisageek> either through improperly configured tech, improperly used tech or people blabbing what they shouldn't
23:15 < kevinisageek> the most secure cell is a cell of one
23:16 < kevinisageek> with no mobile phone
23:16 < kevinisageek> and using a car boot sale laptop with no hard drive on public wifi
23:17 < kevinisageek> keep any data encrypted on some data store outside the jurisdiction of whatever authority is in the area you are in
23:38 < juver> could also be institutionalized perception distortion
23:41 < harlequin> you need to right that up kevinisageek
23:42 < harlequin> or if you dont im going to steal your words and post them everywhere
23:42 < kevinisageek> steal away
23:42 < kevinisageek> i declare them GPL
12:50 < kevinisageek> its pretty simple stuff really
12:50 < kevinisageek> cell of one means no one else to leak data
12:51 < kevinisageek> car boot sale laptop (paid with cash) leaves no data trail
12:51 < kevinisageek> no hard drive means no data can be logged inadvertantly locally
12:51 < kevinisageek> and you should boot from a read only medium (like a cd)
12:51 < kevinisageek> public wifi and no phone should be self explanatory
12:52 < kevinisageek> as should encrypted data stored outwith jurisdiction of local agents
12:53 < kevinisageek> only issue with this I can see is doing everything yourself could be hard
12:54 < kevinisageek> also, plausible deniablility is harder, can't drop your co-conspirators in it if you are the only one
12:54 < kevinisageek> more people does mean division of labour
12:54 < kevinisageek> but increases the risk of data leakage
12:55 < kevinisageek> and informants
12:55 < kevinisageek> wonder if the heinlien method is good
12:56 < kevinisageek> cells of 4 arranged in a pyramid
12:56 < kevinisageek> head honcho at the top
12:56 < kevinisageek> 3 underlings are the heads of their own cells
12:56 < kevinisageek> repeat as neccessary to get the job done
12:56 < kevinisageek> compartmentalisation
12:57 < kevinisageek> though going 40 layers deep gets rather large very quickly
12:57 < harlequin> heinlien makes sense but he was working with a agent that could enver be beat
12:57 < kevinisageek> you want any conspiracy to be as small as possible
12:58 < kevinisageek> small and light makes you agile and fast
12:58 < harlequin> i wonder if a more laize faire approach would work, calls for diffrent 'productions' to be put out,
12:59 < kevinisageek> aye, each "production" doesn't know of the others
12:59 < kevinisageek> brb, GCHQ is at the door...
12:59 < kevinisageek> something about terrorism
12:59 < harlequin> and if more then one team pruduce a effect wht harm can it be, its like open source modeling for real shit
13:00 < harlequin> im out write anything that hits you into a text and keep it for me kev
13:00 < kevinisageek> oh i have more ideas that i am not gonna publish
13:00 < kevinisageek> remind me next time we meet in person
13:01 < kevinisageek> i blame that red team site
13:01 < kevinisageek> and the vast amount of time i have to myself driving where i can think
