Reid and I are going to do a video series on the Modern Minute Man and what the equivalent "Musket, Ball and Powder" should be. Here is a rough list. Is there anything that isn't clear or that is blatantly forgotten. KEEP IN MIND YOU CANNOT CARRY EVERYTHING.

1st Line: Stuff you carry with you ALL the time. Includes any of the stuff you carry in your pockets or on your trouser belt, can include a holstered handgun and knife.

2nd Line: Fighting rig - Chest Rig or plate carrier, etc. Gear that you "wear" that holds all your fighting stuff.

3rd Line: Your assault pack.
