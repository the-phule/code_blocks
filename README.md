A holding point for all those bit of code that I got out of my brain case!

This is really just a uploaded copy of a abunch of random stuff that was in my diaries, notes, and programming examples from the last 15 years. Pretty much it can be ignored unells you want to delve very deeply into my applaing note taking, it's mainly here to allow me to learn github system features, and provide stuff for prosperity.
