How do I avoid being weakshamed by /u/MEatRHIT?

You follow the official MrEatShitÂ© guide to not bragging about mediocre progress; you will be safe if: (assumes healthy 180lb male)

    DL - 400lbs in 6 months to a year, 500 in two years
    Bench - 225lbs in about a year, 315lbs in two years
    Squat - 300lbs in a year, 400lbs in two years

Or you could, you know not worry about what mean people say on the internet......your call.
