Many great responses in this thread. You now know that we have a lot of fun, and that Mr. Rippetoe is not interested in making weight recommendations to people he has never seen. There is no table that I am aware of that gives useful ranges.
Option 1: Use BMI (which is a measure of weight relative to the square of height, not of body composition). If your BMI is below 23 and you are not a competitive endurance athlete you should either start drinking whole milk or get yourself checked for cancer and AIDS. Below this level you are likely to die from being too skinny. If your BMI is between 23 and 30, the weight on the bar is increasing, and your clothes are only too tight on the thighs, butt, and shoulders, you are probably at a fairly healthy weight. If your BMI is above 30 and you are not a competitive powerlifter (actually competitive, not just going to meets, if you asked the OP's question you are not a competitive power lifter) you should be slowing the weight gain down. Depending on your goals and other health issues (diabetes, hypertension) it may be useful to lose a little weight. If your BMI is above 35 and you are not on anabolic steroids you would probably be healthier at a lower weight, and should be able to get to a lower weight without sacrificing much strength if any.
Option 2: waist circumference
You should be as heavy as you can be without your waist circumference exceeding 50-55% of your height.
