So this is the listing I came up with for a 96 hour kit: It's very long and not very complete and is more a list of ideas rather then a packing list, as I fiddle with things it's very likely to change. 

This has nothing to do with the idea behind 72hour kits, BOB's(Bug Out Bags), AWOL Bags(Absent With Out Leave), etc. It's a completely different concept don't confuse issues.
